    "Post-hoc tests are conducted after finding a significant result in an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine which specific group differences are driving the overall significance. Since ANOVA itself doesn't identify where the differences lie, post-hoc tests are employed for pairwise comparisons between groups. Some common post-hoc tests include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD):\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: Tukey's HSD is conservative and suitable when you have unequal sample sizes and want to control the familywise error rate (overall Type I error rate).\n",
    "Example Situation: You conducted a one-way ANOVA and found a significant difference among the means. Tukey's HSD can help identify which specific pairs of groups are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bonferroni Correction:\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: Bonferroni is a more conservative correction that controls the familywise error rate. It is suitable when you have a large number of pairwise comparisons.\n",
    "Example Situation: You have multiple groups, and you want to perform several pairwise comparisons. The Bonferroni correction helps control the overall probability of making a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Duncan's New Multiple Range Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: Duncan's test is less conservative than Tukey's HSD and can be used when sample sizes are equal. It is suitable for identifying differences among means when you have unequal sample sizes.\n",
    "Example Situation: You conducted a one-way ANOVA with unequal sample sizes, and you want to determine which specific groups differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scheffé's Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: Scheffé's test is very conservative but powerful in controlling Type I error rates, making it suitable for situations with unequal sample sizes and a large number of groups.\n",
    "Example Situation: You have a complex experimental design with multiple factors, and you want to perform conservative post-hoc tests to control the overall Type I error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Games-Howell Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: Games-Howell is a robust post-hoc test for situations with unequal variances and sample sizes. It does not assume equal variances across groups.\n",
    "Example Situation: You conducted a one-way ANOVA, and Levene's test indicated unequal variances. Games-Howell can be used to compare specific groups."
